# CRDB Dashboard
 This dashboard is a companion web app for the Fomu Janja mobile app that was created by my other team members. This dashboard allows you to:
 - See all created users
 - Create users that can then use the mobile app
 - Input the token that was generated via the app so you can see the transaction of the specific user

# What I have learned

While I was building the CRDB Dashboard, I learned the fundamentals of React and Context API. I learned how to pass state between different components with the Context API. I have used Reat hooks like useEffect, and useState and used them to change the state depending on the action taken by the user. It was my first project collaborating with other developers and we managed to collaborate with ease.

# What issues I faced and how I resolved them

Collaborating with the other developers working on this was hard at first and we caused a lot of merge conflicts but after googling we managed to solve them and found a way to work together
